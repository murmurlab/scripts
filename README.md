    NAME
                    sleepwipe -- prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility
    SYNOPSIS
                    sleepwipe [-a] [-t timeout]
    DESCRIPTION
                    sleepwipe prevents the system from going to sleep based on specific events.
                    If no events are specified, the sleep prevention is activated indefinitely.
                    A helper event can be specified to perform actions based on that event; for example,
                    waiting for the exit status of a given process ID and reactivating sleep when it exits.
                    Available options:
                    -t              This event prevents the system from going to sleep for the given value (in seconds).
                                    It returns an error if no value is specified.
                    -p              This event prevents the system from going to sleep until the given process ID exits.
                                    If no process ID is specified, an error is thrown.
                    -k              Do not block the computer sleep feature unless you click on some specific keys of
                                    the keyboard and the mouse.

  Valgrind is an open-source tool used for detecting memory errors and performance issues.

    USB debugging must be enabled.

    The bridge is connected to the VPN as a VPN. The apk directly configures the VPN configuration (not only for VPN, but also for running adb forward and reverse commands required for communication between the adb on the server and the adb on the android).

    I do not want to write detailed usage because the program is explained in the repo below.

    The program is started in the last line of the script on the first installation. To run it again, just run the last line.

    USB debugging can also be done wirelessly, so the same things are valid for wireless.

    Multiple devices can be added to a single adb server. If you want to specify manually, gnirehtet [ip:port | serialid].

    This is just the setup script.

    It installs and runs Java without brew for the Java version of gnirehtet.

    The Rust version of gnirehtet is available in the brew repo, it takes about 30 minutes to run, excluding downloading, because it is about 650MB.

    It was taking a long time to compile Java with brew, so it is being installed quickly by downloading compiled source Java 8u331.


    The files downloaded by the script are adbtools java and the source of our program, which is the link below.
